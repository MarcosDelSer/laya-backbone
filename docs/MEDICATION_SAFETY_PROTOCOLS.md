## Executive Summary

This document establishes mandatory medication safety protocols for acetaminophen (Tylenol) administration in LAYA-managed childcare facilities in Quebec. All protocols comply with Quebec regulation FO-0647 and implement evidence-based patient safety mechanisms to prevent medication errors.

### Critical Safety Features

- **Weight-based dosing**: All doses calculated using child's current weight (10-15 mg/kg)
- **Multi-layer validation**: System + human verification before every administration
- **Overdose prevention**: Hard stops for doses exceeding safety thresholds
- **Mandatory revalidation**: Weight updates required every 3 months
- **Complete audit trail**: Every administration permanently logged with timestamps and staff identification

### Zero Tolerance Policy

**Medication administration without proper authorization and validation is strictly prohibited.** Staff who bypass safety protocols face immediate disciplinary action up to and including termination.

## Dose Validation Rules

### 3.1 Weight-Based Dosing Table

The LAYA system implements the Quebec FO-0647 dosing table with strict validation:

#### Weight Range: 4.3 - 5.4 kg

| Concentration | Dose Amount | Total mg | mg/kg |
|--------------|-------------|----------|-------|
| 80 mg/mL drops | 0.6 mL | 48 mg | 10.3 |
| 160 mg/5mL suspension | 1.5 mL | 48 mg | 10.3 |

#### Weight Range: 5.5 - 7.9 kg

| Concentration | Dose Amount | Total mg | mg/kg |
|--------------|-------------|----------|-------|
| 80 mg/mL drops | 0.8 mL | 64 mg | 10.1 |
| 160 mg/5mL suspension | 2 mL | 64 mg | 10.1 |

#### Weight Range: 8.0 - 10.9 kg

| Concentration | Dose Amount | Total mg | mg/kg |
|--------------|-------------|----------|-------|
| 80 mg/mL drops | 1.2 mL | 96 mg | 10.6 |
| 160 mg/5mL suspension | 3 mL | 96 mg | 10.6 |

#### Weight Range: 11.0 - 15.9 kg

| 500 mg tablet | 1 tablet | 500 mg | 15.0 |

### 3.2 Validation Logic

The system performs multi-step validation before allowing medication administration:

#### Step 1: Weight Validity Check
```
✓ Child weight is within range (4.3 - 35 kg)
✓ Weight was recorded within the last 3 months
✓ Weight is not expired (no more than 90 days old)
```

#### Step 2: Concentration Appropriateness
```
✓ Concentration matches child's age group
✓ Infant drops (80 mg/mL): Any age with valid weight
✓ Suspension (160 mg/5mL): 3+ months
✓ Tablets (325/500 mg): 6+ years (72+ months)
```

#### Step 3: Dose Calculation Validation
```
✓ Dose falls within 10-15 mg/kg range
✓ Dose matches approved dosing table for child's weight
✓ Dose does not exceed concentration's maximum safe amount
```

#### Step 4: Timing Validation
```
✓ Minimum 4 hours since last dose
✓ Less than 5 doses in the past 24 hours
✓ Authorization is still active (not expired)
```

#### Step 5: Safety Flag Check
```
✓ No active allergy to acetaminophen
✓ No recent administration at home within 4 hours
✓ Temperature measurement documented
✓ No signs of serious illness requiring immediate medical attention
```

### 3.3 System Validation Messages

The LAYA system provides clear, actionable error messages:

| Validation Failure | System Message | Required Action |
|-------------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Weight expired | "Child's weight was recorded more than 3 months ago (expires: YYYY-MM-DD). Weight must be updated before medication can be administered." | Update child's weight |
| Under-dose | "Dose is below the recommended range (10 mg/kg). Current dose: X mg/kg. Recommended: 10-15 mg/kg." | Increase dose or consult supervisor |
| Over-dose | "OVERDOSE RISK: Dose exceeds maximum safe limit (15 mg/kg). Current dose: X mg/kg. Administration blocked." | Use lower dose from table |
| Wrong concentration | "This concentration is not appropriate for child's age. Child is X months old. Minimum age: Y months." | Select age-appropriate concentration |
| Interval not met | "Minimum 4-hour interval not met. Last dose: X hours ago. Next dose available at: HH:MM." | Wait until interval met |
| Daily limit reached | "Maximum daily dose limit reached (5 doses per 24 hours). Last 24h doses: 5. No further doses allowed today." | Contact parent and healthcare provider |

---

## Weight Revalidation Policy

### 4.1 Rationale

Children's weights change rapidly, especially in the first 3 years of life. Outdated weight measurements can result in:
- **Under-dosing**: Ineffective symptom relief, prolonged discomfort
- **Over-dosing**: Risk of hepatotoxicity, acute liver injury
- **Regulatory non-compliance**: Quebec FO-0647 mandates current weight data

### 4.2 Mandatory Revalidation Schedule

| Parameter | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Revalidation Frequency** | Every 3 months (90 days) |
| **Warning Period** | 14 days before expiry |
| **Grace Period** | None - hard stop at 90 days |
| **Measurement Method** | Calibrated digital scale, child in light clothing |
| **Documentation** | Weight in kg (to 1 decimal place), date recorded, staff signature |

### 4.3 Weight Update Workflow

#### Step 1: Scheduled Weight Measurement (Every 3 Months)

1. **Notification Trigger**: System sends reminder 14 days before weight expiry
   - Email to parents: "Medication authorization requires weight update"
   - Dashboard alert for staff: "Child [Name] - Weight expires in X days"

2. **Measurement at Facility**:
   - Use calibrated scale (annual calibration certificate required)
   - Measure in morning before meals when possible
   - Child in light clothing (remove shoes, heavy clothing)
   - Record weight to 1 decimal place (e.g., 12.4 kg)

3. **Documentation**:
   - Update in LAYA system: Medical Protocol > Authorization > Update Weight
   - Staff member signs electronically with timestamp
   - System automatically calculates new expiry date (+90 days)

#### Step 2: Expired Weight - Hard Stop

If weight is not updated within 90 days:

1. **System Lockout**:
   - Medication administration form becomes inaccessible
   - Red banner displays: "WEIGHT EXPIRED - ADMINISTRATION BLOCKED"
   - Dose calculation tools disabled

2. **Required Actions**:
   - Measure child's weight immediately
   - Update in system
   - Verify new dosing table entry matches current weight
   - Notify parents of weight update requirement

3. **Re-authorization**:
   - System recalculates recommended doses based on new weight
   - Staff reviews updated dosing chart
   - Parents sign revised authorization if dose changes significantly

#### Step 3: Parent-Reported Weights

Parents may report home weights, but facility verification is required:

- **Acceptable**: Parent reports weight → Staff verifies at facility within 7 days
- **Not Acceptable**: Using parent-reported weight without facility verification

### 4.4 Special Circumstances

#### Rapid Weight Change

If child's weight changes by more than 10% since last measurement:

1. **Immediate Re-authorization Required**:
   - Review current medication authorization
   - Recalculate all doses
   - Obtain new parental consent with updated weight
   - Document reason for early weight update

2. **Notify Parents**:
   - Explain dose adjustment rationale
   - Provide new dosing chart for home reference
   - Request home monitoring of weight trends

#### Medical Conditions Affecting Weight

For children with medical conditions causing weight instability:

- **Increased Monitoring**: Monthly weight checks instead of quarterly
- **Healthcare Provider Consultation**: Document any special dosing instructions
- **Enhanced Documentation**: Record weight trends and clinical context

## Overdose Prevention Mechanisms

### 5.1 Multi-Layer Safety Architecture

The LAYA system implements defense-in-depth with multiple independent safety checks:

```
Layer 1: Database Constraints (cannot be bypassed)
  └─ Weight within 4.3-35 kg range
  └─ Dose amount > 0
  └─ Concentration matches enum values

Layer 2: Backend Validation (server-side enforcement)
  └─ DoseValidator class validates mg/kg ratio (10-15 mg/kg)
  └─ Overdose detection (>15 mg/kg = BLOCKED)
  └─ Daily dose limit (5 doses/24h = BLOCKED)
  └─ Minimum interval check (4h required)

Layer 3: Frontend Warnings (user guidance)
  └─ Visual dose safety indicators (green/amber/red)
  └─ Real-time mg/kg calculation display
  └─ Age-based safety warnings
  └─ Dosing chart with recommended ranges

Layer 4: Human Verification (mandatory staff check)
  └─ Staff visually verifies dose amount on dosing chart
  └─ Second staff member witnesses administration (optional but recommended)
  └─ Electronic signature confirms pre-administration checks
```

### 5.2 Overdose Risk Detection

#### Critical Threshold: >15 mg/kg

Any dose exceeding 15 mg/kg triggers an **immediate hard stop**:

```
❌ OVERDOSE RISK DETECTED

Calculated dose: 18.5 mg/kg (for child weight 10.2 kg, dose 188 mg)
Maximum safe dose: 15 mg/kg
Maximum allowed: 153 mg for this child

⚠️ ADMINISTRATION BLOCKED ⚠️

This dose cannot be administered. Use the dosing table to select the
appropriate dose for this child's weight.

Required action: Select lower dose amount from approved dosing table.
```

#### Borderline Doses: 14-15 mg/kg

Doses in the upper range trigger warnings but are not blocked:

```
⚠️ WARNING: Dose is at the high end of the safe range

Calculated dose: 14.7 mg/kg
Safe range: 10-15 mg/kg
Status: Within limits but near maximum

This dose is safe but approaches the maximum threshold. Verify:
✓ Child's weight is current (within 3 months)
✓ No recent acetaminophen dose at home
✓ Child has no liver disease or other contraindications

If uncertain, consult supervisor or use the mid-range dose (12-13 mg/kg).
```

#### Under-Doses: <10 mg/kg

Doses below the therapeutic range are flagged:

```
⚠️ NOTICE: Dose is below the therapeutic range

Calculated dose: 8.2 mg/kg
Therapeutic range: 10-15 mg/kg
Status: Subtherapeutic - may not be effective

This dose may not provide adequate fever/pain relief. Consider:
✓ Verify child's weight is correct
✓ Select higher dose from dosing table if available
✓ Consult dosing chart for recommended amount

If this dose is intentional for a specific medical reason, document
rationale in administration notes.
```

### 5.3 Daily Dose Limit Enforcement

#### 5 Doses per 24 Hours - Hard Stop

The system tracks all doses administered in the past 24 hours:

**Example Timeline**:
```
Day 1:
08:30 - Dose 1 (96 mg, 10.5 mg/kg) ✓ Administered
12:45 - Dose 2 (96 mg, 10.5 mg/kg) ✓ Administered
17:00 - Dose 3 (96 mg, 10.5 mg/kg) ✓ Administered

Day 2:
09:15 - Dose 4 (96 mg, 10.5 mg/kg) ✓ Administered (within 24h of Dose 1)
14:30 - Dose 5 (96 mg, 10.5 mg/kg) ✓ Administered (within 24h of Dose 1)

16:00 - Dose 6 ATTEMPT
        ❌ BLOCKED - Maximum daily dose limit reached
        Last 24h doses: 5 (at 08:30, 12:45, 17:00, 09:15, 14:30)
        Next dose available: Day 2 at 20:30 (after 12:45 dose exits 24h window)
```

**System Message**:
```
❌ MAXIMUM DAILY DOSE LIMIT REACHED

Child has received 5 doses of acetaminophen in the past 24 hours.
No additional doses can be administered until older doses exit the 24-hour window.

Dose history (most recent first):
1. Day 2, 14:30 - 96 mg (10.5 mg/kg)
2. Day 2, 09:15 - 96 mg (10.5 mg/kg)
3. Day 1, 17:00 - 96 mg (10.5 mg/kg)
4. Day 1, 12:45 - 96 mg (10.5 mg/kg)
5. Day 1, 08:30 - 96 mg (10.5 mg/kg)

Next dose available: Day 2, 20:30 (6 hours from now)

REQUIRED ACTIONS:
✓ Contact parents immediately
✓ If fever/pain persists, seek healthcare provider guidance
✓ Do NOT administer additional acetaminophen
✓ Consider non-pharmaceutical interventions (cool compress, rest, hydration)
✓ Document child's ongoing symptoms in daily log
```

### 5.4 Medication Error Prevention

#### Common Error Scenarios and System Protections

| Error Type | How System Prevents It |
|------------|------------------------|
| **Wrong concentration** | Concentration field is dropdown (no free text), validated against age and weight |
| **Calculation mistake** | System calculates mg/kg automatically, no manual calculation allowed |
| **Expired authorization** | Hard stop if authorization end date has passed |
| **Incorrect weight** | Weight expiry validation (3 months), measurement verification required |
| **Dose frequency error** | Real-time 24-hour lookback, interval validation (4h minimum) |
| **Double documentation** | Timestamps and unique record IDs prevent duplicate entries |
| **Missed allergy** | Allergy alerts displayed prominently on administration form |
| **Home dose not recorded** | Mandatory question: "Has child received acetaminophen at home today?" |

#### Staff Verification Checklist

Before every medication administration, staff must verify:

```
PRE-ADMINISTRATION SAFETY CHECKLIST

Child Identification:
□ Correct child selected in system (verify photo and name)
□ Child is present and alert

Authorization Verification:
□ Parental consent is active (not expired)

□ Fewer than 5 doses in past 24 hours
□ No recent dose at home within 4 hours

Medication Verification:
□ Medication bottle label checked (name, concentration, expiry date)
□ Medication is not expired
□ Bottle is properly sealed and stored correctly

Final Verification:
□ Dose measured in calibrated syringe/measuring cup
□ Child's identity re-confirmed
□ Dose administered orally and fully consumed
□ Time of administration documented immediately

I confirm all safety checks have been completed.

## Incident Response Procedures

### 7.1 Emergency Classification

Medication incidents are classified into three levels:

#### Level 1: Near Miss (No Harm)
**Definition**: Error was caught before medication was administered

**Examples**:
- Wrong dose prepared but caught before administration
- System validation blocked inappropriate dose
- Staff double-check identified incorrect concentration

**Response**:
1. Document the near-miss in facility log
2. Discuss with staff member involved (non-punitive, learning focus)
3. Review what system safeguards worked
4. No parent notification required (no harm occurred)

#### Level 2: Minor Incident (Minimal Harm)
**Definition**: Incorrect administration occurred but child experienced no or minimal adverse effects

**Examples**:
- Dose administered 30 minutes early (not quite 4h interval)
- Slightly incorrect dose (within 1 mg/kg of safe range)
- Documentation error (dose was correct but recorded incorrectly)

**Response**:
1. Contact supervisor immediately
2. Notify parents within 1 hour
3. Monitor child for adverse effects (2-hour observation)
4. Document incident in LAYA system + paper incident report
5. Conduct root cause analysis within 24 hours
6. Implement corrective actions
7. No regulatory reporting required (unless facility policy dictates)

#### Level 3: Serious Incident (Harm or High Risk)
**Definition**: Significant medication error with potential for serious harm

**Examples**:
- Overdose administered (>15 mg/kg)
- 6th dose given within 24 hours
- Medication given to wrong child
- Allergic reaction
- Dose administered without parental consent

**Response**:
1. **IMMEDIATE ACTIONS** (within 5 minutes):
   - Contact Poison Control: 1-800-463-5060

5. Flag allergy in child's medical record
6. No further acetaminophen administration

#### Severe Allergic Reaction (Anaphylaxis)
**Symptoms**: Difficulty breathing, swelling of face/lips/tongue, wheezing, rapid pulse, loss of consciousness

**Response**:
1. **CALL 911 IMMEDIATELY**
2. Administer EpiPen if child has one (follow dosing on device)
3. Lay child flat (unless vomiting or breathing difficulty - then semi-upright)
4. Monitor airway and breathing
5. Begin CPR if child stops breathing
6. Contact parents
7. Document all interventions with timestamps

**Post-Event**:
- Facility must file serious incident report
- Child requires medical evaluation before returning
- EpiPen must be replaced if used
- Staff involved receive critical incident debriefing

### 7.4 Incident Documentation

#### Required Documentation Elements

Every incident (Level 1-3) must include:

**Section 1: Incident Details**
